# BMI_Calculator

With this app, I was able to learn more about Optionals, practice the MVC design pattern, and introduce the concept of Classes, comparing objects created from classes with instances of Structs. In the end, I developed a Body Mass Index Calculator based on the userâ€™s weight and height. In summary, through this app, I learned:

* How to create multi-screen apps with animated navigation.
* Optional binding, optional chaining, and the nil coalescing operator.
* How to create classes and the differences between classes and structs.
* Pass by value vs. pass by reference.
* Formatting strings.
